In discussing design and analysis there is a strong emphasis on abstraction. In discussing implementation, general approaches that are applicable in a wide range of procedural programming language are emphasized, in addition to a focus on the details of implementations. Topics include an introduction to asymptotic analysis and a review of basic data structures (stacks, queues, lists, vectors), trees, priority queues, dictionaries, hashing, search trees, sorting (MergeSort, QuickSort, RadixSort) and sets, and graphs (traversals, spanning trees, shortest paths).",

This course explores the relationship between social media applications and the user as a content creator, developer and manager. We explore popular social media applications, their functionality and infrastructure, interface and content design (content creation), search engine optimization and search algorithms(development), and connect them with principles of usability and user experience (management), in order to provide a better understanding of a target users’ behavior on the web. By combining theory and application in a hands-on hybrid learning environment, this course aims to provide a fun and creative way of exploring the behind-the-scenes of social media applications and content creation and management. Whether you are interested on podcasting, vodcasting, streaming, video sharing, or other forms of storytelling, you can tailor this course based on your personal goals, and better showcase yourself as an artist, marketer, or influencer, and increase the visibility of your brand.",

This course aims at developing the ethical reasoning skills and sensitivities that computer professionals will need to make good decisions and to justify them. The course includes a general introduction to ethical theories and their use in making and justifying decisions. We then consider various issues and case studies, illustrating the kinds of problems that can arise from the use and misuse of computers and technology: the responsibilities of computing professionals; ethics on the internet (hacking, computer crime, netiquette); privacy and information; intellectual property; social and political issues (digital divide, computers and work, the internet as a democratic technology).",

It also provides students with hands-on experience with modern non-object-oriented imperative programming languages, including functional and logic programming.  The goal is to broaden the students’ understanding of the landscape of programming languages and to enable them to compare the capabilities of different programming languages with the goal of choosing an appropriate language for a given project.",

The course seeks to develop students’ strategic planning skills and teamworking abilities, while encouraging entrepreneurial thinking. By examining how digital companies are created, why digital products fail, and how risks of failure may be minimized, students develop independent research skills and their ability for critical thinking. The course aims to develop students’ capacity to apply knowledge, tools, techniques, project management and leadership principles to the creation of unique business models for the development and management of innovative digital products and services; they will identify appropriate branding and marketing strategies, and communication channels to deliver strategic plans effectively.",

Those results enable efficient transmission and storage of massive datasets, but often we want to work with those datasets without decompressing them, so the second part of the course will cover compressed data structures and computation over compressed data. The third part of the course will review the development of data structures for pangenomics as a case study in handling massive but highly compressible datasets.",

Deep learning’s ability to utilize and learn complex functions from vast amounts of data, its adaptability to a wide range of data types, and the availability of powerful computational resources, have enabled its application to numerous real-world tasks. Deep learning has transformed various fields by achieving unprecedented performance in tasks such as image classification, natural language dialog, and robot navigation, to name a few. This course is designed to provide an application-focused exploration of deep learning. Students will learn about the various applications of deep learning and the underlying concepts and methods (in the context of the applications) to build and utilize deep learning methods effectively.",

Those results enable ef?cient transmission and storage of massive datasets, but often we want to work with those datasets without decompressing them, so the second part of the course will cover compressed data structures and computation over compressed data.

This course introduces fundamental concepts and principals used in NLP with emphasis on statistical approaches to NLP and unification-based grammars. In the application part of the course, we discuss the problems of question answering, machine translation, text classification, information extraction, grammar induction, and dictionary generation and other.",

        "description": "The goal of this course is to help students in the Computer Science Work Experience Program get the most out of their work term. Since the work term is a form of work-integrated learning (WIL), the aim of this course is to enable students to form successful work habits; develop employability skills &amp; competencies (i.e. graduate attributes); and leverage the work term to explore their career path.  Through the on-line portion of the course, work term assignments will provide students the opportunity to reflect on work experiences with a view to deepen learning in their workplace",
