Slavery in Canada, which is often missing from studies of slavery in the Americas, will also be explored. It should be borne in mind that slavery was simultaneously a labour, legal, carceral, sexual, racial, and gender system.","termClasses":[{"term":"202520","instructors":[],"section":"01","type":"Lec","days":["T","R"],"time":{"start":"1605","end":"1725"},"location":"Studley MCCAIN ARTS&SS 1130","crn":"24278","course":"BAFD3380"}],"location":"Studley MCCAIN ARTS&SS 1130","enrollement":{"enrolled":2,"capacity":5},"instructorsByTerm":{"202520":["Whitfield H.

The rise of external slave trades after 1700 — notably across the Atlantic and Sahara — transformed many African societies into specialized slave exporters. As external slave trades declined in the 19th century, many African economies used extensive internal slave labour to produce exports, a pattern colonial governments were slow to change in the 20th century. This course examines these changes in African slavery, and how they affected such issues as gender relations and class structure.","termClasses":[{"term":"202520","instructors":[],"section":"01","type":"Lec","days":["R"],"time":{"start":"0835","end":"1125"},"location":"Studley MCCAIN ARTS&SS 2017","crn":"24108","course":"BAFD3435"}],"location":"Studley MCCAIN ARTS&SS 2017","enrollement":{"enrolled":4,"capacity":6},"instructorsByTerm":{"202520":["Zachernuk P.

The collapse of Enron, Global Crossing, and WorldCom in the United States revealed the wide-scale shenanigans of their boards of directors. The failure of Parmalat and Swissair rekindled concerns about the effectiveness of monitoring boards in Europe. Similarly, in Canada, the failure of Bre-X, Cinar, Hollinger, Livent, and YBM Magnex illustrates the prankishness of their board members and the degree of their lack of concern for stockholders' interests. The failure of Lehman Brothers as recently as August-September 2008 has been attributed to poor monitoring by its board. Clearly, poor governance has led to the death of these once successful, highly admired large corporations and to massive losses and restructuring in many other cases across the globe. The reputation of audit and consulting companies associated with these ill-fated corporations suffered a great setback, leaving stakeholders wondering whom to trust to safeguard their interests! Besides, drastic changes in different types of work environments have imposed significant challenges for the governance of contemporary organizations. Corporate Governance is designed to give students an in-depth look at the corporate governance triad, as indicated above, that controls the modern corporation.

You will also understand some of the basic tax considerations that underpin regular business activities, like hiring a worker, incorporating, or selling a business.","termClasses":[{"term":"202520","instructors":[],"section":"01","type":"Lec","days":["M"],"time":{"start":"1735","end":"1855"},"location":"Online-SYNCHRONOUS SESSION","crn":"24260","course":"BUSI6105"}],"location":"Online-SYNCHRONOUS SESSION","enrollement":{"enrolled":25,"capacity":50},"instructorsByTerm":{"202520":["Brooks K.

Questions such as the role of ‘nature’ in defining human happiness, the good life, and the character of political power will figure prominently. We will attend to the limits of ‘natural’ reason in relation to established disciplines like theology, as well as more contested areas of knowledge such as magic, astrology and alchemy. The approach taken will be that of intellectual history, in the sense that we will focus on fundamental concepts articulated by the authors and on careful textual exegesis, while always attentive to the wider historical and cultural contexts. Especially given that this course's authors, texts and contexts are quite distant in time from our contemporary world, there will also be occasions for us to reflect on the challenges facing the modern inquirer into pre-modern conceptions of nature and scientific knowledge.","termClasses":[{"term":"202520","instructors":[],"section":"01","type":"Lec","days":["T","R"],"time":{"start":"1435","end":"1555"},"location":"King's KING'S NEW ACAD ARCHIB","crn":"20542","course":"CLAS2002"}],"location":"King's KING'S NEW ACAD ARCHIB","enrollement":{"enrolled":27,"capacity":30},"instructorsByTerm":{"202520":["Stewart I.

From an examination of nineteenth-century natural theology and the religious impact of Darwin’s Origin of Species (1859), this course moves on to such contemporary topics as the religious interpretations of quantum mechanics, the Big Bang, the anthropic principle, medical science, bioethics, evolutionary psychology, chaos theory, aesthetics in nature, science fiction, extra-terrestrial life (including the SETI Project) and the quest for techno-immortality. Case studies of “conflict” emanating from Darwinism, the Scopes Trial, the on-going Creation-Evolution debates and the New Atheism are contrasted with examples of harmony and interdependence between science and religion in the careers of modern scientists, along with phenomena like neurotheology and the Intelligent Design (ID) movement. The religious scope of the course is intentionally wide-ranging, and examinations of science-religion interaction within indigenous spirituality are added to treatments of traditional eastern and western religion.","termClasses":[{"term":"202520","instructors":[],"section":"01","type":"Lec","days":["T","R"],"time":{"start":"1605","end":"1725"},"location":"King's KING'S ARTS&ADM SEM7, SEM7","crn":"20868","course":"CTMP3201"}],"location":"King's KING'S ARTS&ADM SEM7, SEM7","enrollement":{"enrolled":5,"capacity":5},"instructorsByTerm":{"202520":["Snobelen S.

We begin by examining phenomenological attempts to overcome dualistic accounts of the relations between perceiver and perceived, mind and body, and mind and world.

Home is a place of comfort and belonging; it is a domestic setting, a language, a nationality and a series of identifications that ‘place’ and maintain individuals. The notion of home is opposed to key diagnoses of the modern condition--as alienated, displaced, estranged and uncanny, for example. These diagnoses have been applied both to psychological conditions and to actual social phenomena of mass displacements, refugees, immigration and exile. The social imaginary of many historically displaced groups centres around the return to or establishment of a homeland.This course will consider literary and artistic representations of ‘home’, the phenomenology of ‘homeliness’ and of its strange double, the uncanny, and the stakes that post-war philosophy has in the notions of rootedness, place and dwelling.","termClasses":[{"term":"202520","instructors":[],"section":"01","type":"Lec","days":["T","R"],"time":{"start":"1605","end":"1725"},"location":"King's KING'S NEW ACAD ARCHIB","crn":"20870","course":"CTMP3340"}],"location":"King's KING'S NEW ACAD ARCHIB","enrollement":{"enrolled":15,"capacity":30},"instructorsByTerm":{"202520":["Penny L.

Examining Mannerism and its critics in the Catholic Reformation sets the ground for the 17th century reform of art spurred on by Caravaggio and the Carracci.

We will begin by studying different logics under which humans have worried that 'natural' disasters might be manmade, focusing on recent scholarship that argues that social inequalities shape the impacts of disaster. Next, we study specific sciences of disaster and the imperial settings in which they developed. We will then consider the political processes by which new events have come to be recognized as natural\ndisasters.

From an examination of nineteenth-century natural theology and the religious impact of Darwin’s Origin of Species (1859), this course moves on to such contemporary topics as the religious interpretations of quantum mechanics, the Big Bang, the anthropic principle, medical science, bioethics, evolutionary psychology, chaos theory, aesthetics in nature, science fiction, extra-terrestrial life (including the SETI Project) and the quest for techno-immortality. Case studies of “conflict” emanating from Darwinism, the Scopes Trial, the on-going Creation-Evolution debates and the New Atheism are contrasted with examples of harmony and interdependence between science and religion in the careers of modern scientists, along with phenomena like neurotheology and the Intelligent Design (ID) movement.

After acquiring a toolkit of useful ideas, the course looks at some early slaving systems, and then compares them to the rich literature on ancient Greek and Roman slavery.  Slavery in Atlantic world is then added to this comparative framework, with a particular interest in the lives of the enslaved.

In this class, we will challenge the thesis that the Raj begins in India by studying the dynamics of empire, war, and resistance on the small island state of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in the Indian Ocean. No prior knowledge of the region is required, this course is meant to introduce students to the global history, politics, and conflicts that contoured the development of modern/colonial Ceylon, known today as “Sri Lanka.” We focus on the imperial conflicts that defined the period of British colonial rule (1802 – 1948), but towards the end of the class, emphasize how these historical events continue to impact post-colonial Sri Lanka in terms of ethnonationalist strife and Asian geopolitics. In so doing, part of the conceptual work of this course is to draw into contention the stability with which we think of the term “post” colonial in terms of states within the former British empire.","termClasses":[{"term":"202520","instructors":[],"section":"01","type":"Lec","days":["F"],"time":{"start":"1135","end":"1425"},"location":"Studley MCCAIN ARTS&SS 2170","crn":"21411","course":"HIST3520"}],"location":"Studley MCCAIN ARTS&SS 2170","enrollement":{"enrolled":33,"capacity":35},"instructorsByTerm":{"202520":["Parasram A.

The Canadian regional round of the competition is a national mooting competition for Canadian law students and the majority of the law schools across the country usually participate. The moot problem always contains issues redolent of a topical international affair. The Jessup Moot is sponsored by the International Law Students Association, based in Washington, D.C. Philip C. Jessup, for whom the competition is named, was one of America's most respected jurists on the International Court of Justice. Work on the competition begins in September and proceeds up to the Canadian regional round, which is held in February or March. Each team is judged on its memorials, or written arguments, and on its oral presentation. Each team must prepare a memorial for each side and must argue the case six (6) times, three times for each side. A panel of experienced judges, commonly including justices from across Canada, scores the oral presentations. Jessup Moot team members will be expected to complete the requirements of the Canadian national competition to earn academic credit.  SELECTION:  By an application process, possibly involving a mock oral argument, in Winter term of second year, for team participation in third year. Prior completion of an International Law course is strongly recommended.

International Humanitarian Law has been an important component of international law for centuries.  It is a body of preventive law which is intended to reduce net human suffering by limiting the right of parties to a conflict to use methods and means of warfare and to protect persons and property that may be affected by conflict.  As states are less willing to accept restrictions on how they fight than to accept restrictions on how they treat victims of war and less willing to accept restrictions on how they treat internal opponents than to accept restrictions on how they treat the nationals of other states, the laws concerning protection of victims are more elaborate than those which affect war fighting and the laws for international conflicts are more elaborate than those which apply to non-international conflicts.  There is a debate concerning the extent to which the law applies to transnational non-state actors (the Global War on Terror).  The course will address how law purports to regulate conduct in extreme situations.  It will also endeavour to assess how new legal approaches might be used to strengthen the law and provide enhanced protection to victims of war.  Specific topics addressed may vary from year to year depending on student and instructor interest.

These have become supplemented by workers compensation legislation, unemployment insurance schemes, regulatory regimes for pensions, occupational health and safety statutes, and the like. Human rights legislation, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, international treaties and supra-national institutions have also had a striking impact on regulation of the workplace. In addition to these evolving legal parameters, the globalized “new economy” has changed the nature of work and its regulation in a need for what many Europeans term “flexicurity”: flexibility for workers and industries to compete successfully in new markets and security for vulnerable workers and industries as they face challenges under such conditions. Integrated labour markets are becoming a key subject of concern for those promoting balanced economic, social and political development under contemporary conditions for international trade and investment. This course will explore a constellation of these legal and policy issues, which may vary from year to year in accordance with the focus of the scholar invited to teach the course.

There will be three major sections to the seminar, designed to help students develop skills to represent and assist incarcerated clients in a variety of legal situations by developing a critical understanding of how incarceration can change the legal system’s rules of engagement for such individuals. The first section is normative. We will look at the penological and legislative purpose of imprisonment, the different types of custodial institutions within Canada, the laws that regulate incarceration in Canada and in the provinces, the rights that apply to prisoners, the problems that may arise in the prison context, and the specific remedial mechanisms created to protect prisoners in the institutional setting. The second section is analytical and interdisciplinary. We will look at the specific issues that incarceration raises as it interacts with other aspects of law and society, including family, aboriginality, labour, property, end of life planning etc. We will also look at the legal tools available to prisoners or former prisoners seeking to engage with these socio-legal issues, and ask how effective they are. The third section is practical. It will consist of a site visit to a prison, in order to familiarize students with the environment and to allow them to engage with prisoners and to receive first-hand accounts of the issues we will have discussed in class. Each student will deliver a written material and a presentation to prisoners summarizing the law in a field relevant for prisoners (custody issues, divorce, immigration, human rights issues etc).

Moreover, employers such as Pixar, AirBnb, the Government of Canada and the United Nations, to name a few, have identified the ability to promote innovation and engage in creative practices as essential competencies for their employees and future leaders. Many of these organizations adopt an approach to innovative problem solving called Design Thinking. Design Thinking’s mindset, process and rich collection of methods emphasize the importance of keeping an understanding of people and communities at the core of problem-solving efforts.  A design thinking exercise offers the promise of producing ideas and solutions that are desirable for the user (of a product or service), customer or community. \n\nThis course will explore what we mean when use the word innovation and its relevance to today’s organizations and workforce.  We will devote some time to understanding barriers to creativity, the impact of these barriers to innovative pursuits and how they might be overcome.  Finally, we will take an in-depth look at Design Thinking – its foundations, methods, and challenges with execution. This course combines theory and application.

From an examination of nineteenth-century natural theology and the religious impact of Darwin’s Origin of Species (1859), this course moves on to such contemporary topics as the religious interpretations of quantum mechanics, the Big Bang, the anthropic principle, medical science, bioethics, evolutionary psychology, chaos theory, aesthetics in nature, science fiction, extra-terrestrial life (including the SETI Project) and the quest for techno-immortality. Case studies of “conflict” emanating from Darwinism, the Scopes Trial, the on-going Creation-Evolution debates and the New Atheism are contrasted with examples of harmony and interdependence between science and religion in the careers of modern scientists, along with phenomena like neurotheology and the Intelligent Design (ID) movement. The religious scope of the course is intentionally wide-ranging, and examinations of science-religion interaction within indigenous spirituality are added to treatments of traditional eastern and western religion.","termClasses":[{"term":"202520","instructors":[],"section":"01","type":"Lec","days":["T","R"],"time":{"start":"1605","end":"1725"},"location":"King's KING'S ARTS&ADM SEM7, SEM7","crn":"22630","course":"RELS3201"}],"location":"King's KING'S ARTS&ADM SEM7, SEM7","enrollement":{"enrolled":2,"capacity":5},"instructorsByTerm":{"202520":["Snobelen S.

Whether one uses terms like “postindustrialism”, “postmaterialism” or “postmodernism”, debates have centered on the question of fundamental alterations in the economic, cultural and political organization of technologically advanced societies. Are we witnessing the creation of an “information economy”, are we observing the emergence of a new “knowledge class”, which rules by virtue of its educational skills and credentials, is there a new underclass being excluded from paid employment of any form, and is government being privatized to facilitate new forms of global economic integration?  Are new types of social movements arising in response to basic changes in our society?

So many aspects of our lives are regulated by and measured against socially defined norms and standards, from our weight and sexual behavior, to how we dress and which substances we consume. But social norms get violated, too, and such ‘deviance’ has long been a preoccupation of sociologists and social anthropologists. What and who counts as deviant and how deviance is managed vary dramatically across historical periods, cultures, and regimes of social control. By applying social theories of deviance and normalization to case studies in health, law/crime, and morality, this course encourages students to think more critically about how and why our society responds to difference. In the first half of the course, we will focus on the concept of norms and on sociological approaches to theorizing deviance from social norms. In the second half of the course, our focus shifts to experiences and techniques of social control--the management of deviants and deviance.
